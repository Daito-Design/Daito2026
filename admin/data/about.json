      "Daito Design was founded on a simple insight: enterprise software is broken because it's designed by people who have never used it. We set out to change that.",
      "Over the past 15 years, we've spent time on offshore platforms, in nuclear control rooms, and alongside geoscientists making billion-dollar decisions. We've learned that great design isn't about aesthetics—it's about understanding the real constraints of extreme environments.",
      "Our approach is radically different. We don't accept abstractions. We visit your sites. We shadow your operators. We understand your workflows before we touch a design tool. And we stick around—most of our client relationships span years, not months."
